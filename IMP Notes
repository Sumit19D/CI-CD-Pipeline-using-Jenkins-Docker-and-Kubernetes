Allow Jenkins Docker access
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
sudo systemctl restart jenkins

why to allow jenkins Docekr access because 
Jab hum Jenkins me JOB create karke Run karte hai tab jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/(JOB-name) iss folder me Dockerfile search karta hai  agar jenkins ko iss path me Dockerfile nahi mili
toh JOB fail hota hai...Tab hum "Allow Jenkins Docker access" commands use karte hai.
then we can see the humari entire github repository is showing under /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/(JOB-name)
and then we can mention the dockerfile path in the pipeline

We can not execute any sudo commands in jenkins 
Because
Jenkins user is system-created
No password is set
So sudo will always fail


Check if kubeconfig exists for Jenkins---Means jenkins is not having kubectl access
ls -l /var/lib/jenkins/.kube/config

Copy kubeconfig to Jenkins user
From ubuntu user run below commands
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/jenkins/.kube
sudo cp /home/ubuntu/.kube/config /var/lib/jenkins/.kube/config
sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/.kube

Best Practice (Production / Interview-Ready)

Instead of copying kubeconfig: Use Jenkins Credentials + kubeconfig

Jenkins → Manage Credentials
Add Secret File
Upload kubeconfig
ID: kubeconfig
